Additional comments:

```
Please omit the redundant "An R package" at the end/start of your title and description.

Please write references in the description of the DESCRIPTION file in the form
authors (year) <doi:...>
authors (year) <arXiv:...>
authors (year, ISBN:...)
or if those are not available: authors (year) <https:...>
with no space after 'doi:', 'arXiv:', 'https:' and angle brackets for auto-linking. (If you want to add a title as well please put it in quotes: "Title")

Please fix and resubmit.
```

* Removed phrases containing `package`
* Added a citation to authors (year) <doi:...> format
